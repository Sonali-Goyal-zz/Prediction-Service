Whether you are selling clothes, industrial equipment, or digital gadgets or even if you own an online store, inventory forecasting is a key element of your supply chain planning. Accurate inventory forecast means there will be no shortages or excess stock. As a result, you can increase operating cash flow, reduce inventory carrying costs and generate higher profits.

The approach  is dynamic, so that it can be continually updated and adjusted as each month passes and additional information is developed.
